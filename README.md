**2b(i)**  John Smith, Customer ID - GR01932, has asked for a copy of the tax he has paid on flight QH182. The tax for a booking is calculated as follows:  

- adults pay £5.50

**2b(ii)**  The airline wishes to identify the customer(s) who made a booking with the greatest number of children.  
Implement two SQL statements that will find the forename and surname of the customer(s) who made a booking with the greatest number of children.

Screenshot of evidence of the output it produced goes here (just leave the SQL in Main.sql with a ; at the end of the query) **(4 marks)**
